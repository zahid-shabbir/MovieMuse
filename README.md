# MovieMuse



## Code Overview:
The code provided is a Swift protocol and its implementation for a movie fetching service. It fetches popular movies and searches movies by name from a server. It also has a placeholder for toggling the favorite status of a movie. The network calls are made using Combine framework.

## Class and Method Names:
The class and method names clearly show their intent and responsibility. The MovieService protocol provides an abstract layer for movie services, and the APIMovieService class implements it. The function names are well-chosen and reveal their purpose.

## 'SOLID' Principles:
The code follows the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by using a MovieService protocol which APIMovieService implements. It also adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) as classes depend on the abstraction MovieService and not on concrete classes. To fully comply with SOLID principles, you would need to ensure Liskov's Substitution Principle, Open-Closed Principle and Single Responsibility Principle are also followed across the entire project.

## App Architecture:
The architecture used here is protocol-oriented programming (MVVM-R) which is a popular choice for Swift projects.

## UI and Non-UI Separation:
The MovieService protocol separates non-UI related network calls from UIViewController classes. UIViewController classes can use this protocol without knowing the implementation details, thereby fulfilling point 4.

## Class and Method Lengths:
Methods in the provided code are short and focused on a single task, conforming to point 5.

## Accommodating Future Requirement Changes:
With the protocol-oriented design, you can add additional methods in the protocol and then provide implementation in the classes conforming to it. This allows you to easily accommodate possible future requirement changes.

## OOP and POP Skills:
The code is a good example of Protocol Oriented Programming (POP) skills.

## Testability:
The protocol design of the service makes it easy to mock for unit testing. You can create a mock service conforming to the MovieService protocol and use it for tests.

## Data Caching and Image Loading:
This isn't demonstrated in the provided code but should be implemented in other parts of the app.

## Device Support:
This is handled at the project level and not in the code provided.

## Third-Party Libraries:
There don't appear to be any third-party libraries in the code provided.

## Code Documentation:
While there aren't any comments in the provided code, the code is self-documenting due to meaningful names.

## Warnings and Errors:
No warnings or errors are visible in the provided code.

## Design Pattern and Architecture:
The code uses the MVVM-Router, Protocol-Oriented Programming, design pattern. This pattern allows for easier testing and better separation of concerns.

## User Guide:
A user guide isn't applicable to this section of the code, but would be a valuable addition to the overall project.

## Important Developer Notes:
The developer should note that URL encoding is required for the search movie endpoint, and that the favorite status toggle functionality is not yet implemented.

## Unit Test Info:
While no unit tests are provided, the design of the code allows for easy unit testing. By creating a mock service that conforms to the MovieService protocol, the developer can test how classes that depend on the service behave under different conditions.
